        <h2> Choose Your Own Waifuu</h2>
        <p> You can't find a perfect waifu without knowing who you are yourself. <br> 
            Just because everyone else thinks yanderes are awesome and have Yuno as their waifu doesn't mean you want some psycho chick stalking you all day and killing your friends. <br>
             On the other hand, you don't want to see a character in the anime you're watching and be like "That's the one. She's my waifu." and then end up with 8572 waifus. Be honest with yourself. <br>
              Know that just because she seems like the ultimate waifu doesn't mean she's right for you. Likewise, not every waifu could be your waifu.</p>

            <h2>Top 3 Bitches</h2>
            <p>The release of Apple Silicon-based Macs at the end of last year generated a flurry of news coverage and some surprises at the machine’s performance. This post details some background information on the experience of porting Firefox to run natively on these CPUs.</p>
            <p>We’ll start with some background on the Mac transition and give an overview of Firefox internals that needed to know about the new architecture, before moving on to the concept of Universal Binaries.</p>
            <p>We’ll then explain how DRM/EME works on the new platform, talk about our experience with macOS Big Sur, and discuss various updater problems we had to deal with. We’ll conclude with the release and an overview of various other improvements that are in the pipeline.</p>
